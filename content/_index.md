Hey I'm Senne, I like to create complex projects. Recently found out on a trust-worthy site I am borderline autistic. This explains why I use dwm and NixOS.

If you want to learn more about how to 'maximize autism' and how I have everything configured, check out the [Dots](/dots) section.

I'm working on a private email for contact since I don't want to receive offers from Nigerian princes.
