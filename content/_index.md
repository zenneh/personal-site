Welcome to my personal site. Recently found out on a trust-worthy site I am borderline autistic. This explains why I use dwm and NixOS.

If you want to learn more about how to **maximize autism** and how I have everything configured, check out the [Dots]({{< ref "/dots">}} "dots") section.

I'm working on a private email for contact since I don't want to receive offers from Nigerian princes.

If you want to read a based blog about programming, fitness and random thoughts check out my Posts.
